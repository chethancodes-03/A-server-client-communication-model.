A simple Server - Client Communication established with IP address, using socket based technology.
# Server-Client Communication

This is a simple Java-based Server-Client Communication project. It demonstrates how to establish a connection between a server and a client using Java sockets. The server and client can exchange messages over the network.

## Introduction

In this project, we've implemented a basic server and client application in Java. The server listens for incoming connections from clients, and clients can send messages to the server. The server processes these messages and sends back responses to the clients.

This project serves as a foundation for building more complex client-server applications, such as chat systems, remote control systems, or data exchange platforms.

## Features

- **Client-Server Communication**: Establish a socket-based connection between a server and multiple clients.

- **Message Exchange**: Send and receive messages between the server and clients.

- **Scalable**: The project can be extended to include additional features and functionality as needed.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/server-client-communication.git

### Prerequisites

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/server-client-communication.git
2.Compile the Java files:
  "javac Server.java Client.java"
3. Run the server:
  "java Server"
4. Run Client:
  "java Client"

Usage:
Start the server and one or more clients as described in the installation steps.

Clients can enter text messages, and the server will receive and process these messages.

The server can send responses back to clients.

Experiment with the code to understand how server-client communication works.
